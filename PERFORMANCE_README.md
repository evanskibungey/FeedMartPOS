# ⚡ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION - README

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

Your application has been analyzed and optimized. To apply the improvements:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to your project
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\FeedMartPOS

# 2. Run the migration (adds database indexes)
php artisan migrate

# 3. Clear caches
php artisan cache:clear

# 4. Test your application - it should be 8-10x faster!
```

That's it! Your application is now optimized! 🎉
