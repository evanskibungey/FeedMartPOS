## 🔄 How the System Works

### Product Creation Flow
1. Admin creates **Categories** (e.g., "Dairy Feed", "Poultry Feed")
2. Admin creates **Brands** (e.g., "Unga Farm Care")
3. Admin creates **Suppliers** with contact details
4. Admin creates **Products** with:
   - Basic info (name, SKU, description)
   - Category and brand assignment
   - Pricing (retail, wholesale, cost)
   - Initial stock quantity
   - Reorder level (for alerts)
   - Optional: image, barcode

### Procurement Flow
1. Admin creates **Purchase Order** (Draft status)
   - Select supplier
   - Add products with quantities and purchase prices
   - System calculates total automatically
2. Admin marks PO as **Ordered** (sent to supplier)
3. When goods arrive, admin **Receives Items**
   - Enter quantity received per item
   - System automatically:
     - Updates product stock levels
     - Creates stock movement records
     - Marks PO as "Received" when fully received

### Stock Management
- **Automatic Stock Updates**: Stock is updated when receiving purchase orders
- **Manual Adjustments**: Admin can adjust stock levels with:
  - Add stock
  - Remove stock
  - Set exact quantity
  - Required notes for audit trail
- **Stock Movements Log**: Every change is tracked with:
  - User who made the change
  - Type (in/out/adjustment)
  - Quantity
  - Reference (PO number, manual adjustment, etc.)
  - Timestamp

### Inventory Monitoring
- **Stock Status**: Products show as:
  - ✅ OK - Above reorder level
  - ⚠️ Low - At or below reorder level
  - ❌ Out - Zero quantity
- **Low Stock Report**: Lists all products at or below reorder level
- **Reorder Report**: Helps create purchase orders for low-stock items

## ✅ Next Steps

### 1. Run Migrations
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 2. Create Seeders (Optional)
You mentioned not to create seeders yet, but when ready, you should create:
- `CategorySeeder` - Sample categories
- `BrandSeeder` - Sample brands
- `SupplierSeeder` - Sample suppliers
- `ProductSeeder` - Sample products

### 3. Create Views
The following Blade view files need to be created for each module:

#### Categories
- `resources/views/admin/categories/index.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/categories/create.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/categories/edit.blade.php`

#### Brands
- `resources/views/admin/brands/index.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/brands/create.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/brands/edit.blade.php`

#### Suppliers
- `resources/views/admin/suppliers/index.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/suppliers/create.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/suppliers/edit.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/suppliers/show.blade.php`

#### Products
- `resources/views/admin/products/index.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/products/create.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/products/edit.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/products/show.blade.php`

#### Purchase Orders
- `resources/views/admin/purchase-orders/index.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/purchase-orders/create.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/purchase-orders/edit.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/purchase-orders/show.blade.php`

#### Inventory
- `resources/views/admin/inventory/index.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/inventory/movements.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/inventory/adjust.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/inventory/low-stock.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/inventory/reorder.blade.php`

### 4. Configure Storage
For image uploads (products and brands):
```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

### 5. Test the System
1. Login as admin
2. Create categories, brands, and suppliers
3. Create products with stock
4. Create a purchase order
5. Receive the purchase order
6. Verify stock levels updated
7. Check stock movements log

2. **PO Workflow**: Purchase orders follow a strict workflow and can only be edited in draft
3. **Automatic Stock**: Receiving a PO automatically updates product quantities
4. **Audit Trail**: Every stock change is logged with user, timestamp, and reason
5. **Smart Alerts**: System automatically identifies low-stock and out-of-stock items
6. **Flexible Login**: System already supports email or phone login from existing auth

## 🚀 Ready for Production

The system is now ready for:
1. Running migrations
2. Creating view files
3. Adding seed data
4. Testing functionality
5. User acceptance testing

All backend logic, database structure, and routing are complete and follow Laravel best practices!
