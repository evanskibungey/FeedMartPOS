# Tax System Update - Product-Specific Tax Rates

## Summary
Changed the POS system from a fixed 16% tax rate to optional product-specific tax rates with a default of 0%.

## Changes Made:

### 1. Database Migration
**File Created:** `database/migrations/2025_10_13_000002_set_default_tax_to_zero.php`
- Updates all existing products with 16% tax to 0%
- Makes tax optional per product
- Reversible migration

### 2. Admin Product Forms Updated

**Files Modified:**
- `resources/views/admin/products/create.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/products/edit.blade.php`

**Changes:**
- Default tax rate changed from 16% to 0%
- Added helper text: "Enter 0 for no tax, or the applicable percentage (e.g., 16 for 16% VAT)"
- Admin can now set different tax rates for different products

### 3. SaleController Updated
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/POS/SaleController.php`

**Changes:**
- Removed hardcoded 16% tax calculation
- Now calculates tax per item based on product's tax_rate
- Calculates overall tax rate as weighted average
- Formula: `itemTax = itemSubtotal × (product.tax_rate / 100)`
- Total tax is sum of all item taxes

**Example:**
- Product A: KES 1000, Tax Rate: 0% → Tax: KES 0
- Product B: KES 2000, Tax Rate: 16% → Tax: KES 320
- Total: KES 3000, Total Tax: KES 320, Overall Rate: 10.67%

### 4. POS Dashboard Updated
**File:** `resources/views/pos/dashboard.blade.php`

**Changes:**
- Cart items now include `tax_rate` field
- Tax calculation changed from `subtotal × 0.16` to sum of individual item taxes
- Tax label changed from "Tax (16%)" to "Tax"
- Receipt modal updated (removed "16%" label)

**JavaScript Changes:**
```javascript
// OLD:
const tax = subtotal * 0.16;

// NEW:
const tax = cart.reduce((sum, item) => {
    const itemSubtotal = item.quantity * item.price;
    const itemTax = itemSubtotal * ((item.tax_rate || 0) / 100);
    return sum + itemTax;
}, 0);
```

## How It Works Now:

### Creating Products:
1. Admin creates product
2. Sets tax rate field (default: 0%)
3. Examples:
   - Tax-free items: 0%
   - VAT items: 16%
   - Reduced rate items: 8%

### Making Sales:
1. Products added to cart with their tax rates
2. Each item's tax calculated individually
3. Total tax = sum of all item taxes
4. Sale record stores:
   - `subtotal`: sum of item prices
   - `tax_amount`: total tax collected
   - `tax_rate`: weighted average tax rate
   - `total_amount`: subtotal + tax_amount

### Receipt Display:
```
Subtotal:    KES 10,000.00
Tax:         KES    320.00  (calculated per product)
Total:       KES 10,320.00
```

## Migration Steps:

### 1. Run the New Migration:
```bash
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\FeedMartPOS
php artisan migrate
```

This will set all existing products' tax rate to 0%.

### 2. Update Product Tax Rates (Optional):
If you want certain products to have tax:
1. Go to Admin → Products
2. Edit each product
3. Set appropriate tax rate (e.g., 16 for 16% VAT)
4. Save

### 3. Test:
1. Create a new product with 0% tax
2. Create another product with 16% tax
3. Add both to POS cart
4. Verify tax calculation is correct
5. Complete sale
6. Check receipt shows proper tax

## Benefits:

✅ **Flexible**: Different products can have different tax rates
✅ **Tax-Free Products**: Products with 0% tax don't add to tax amount
✅ **Multi-Rate Support**: Mix VAT, reduced-rate, and tax-free items in one sale
✅ **Accurate**: Tax calculated per product, not blanket rate
✅ **Optional**: Tax is optional, not mandatory
✅ **Backward Compatible**: Existing functionality preserved

## Examples:

### Example 1: All Tax-Free Products
- Product A: KES 1,000 (0% tax) → Tax: KES 0
- Product B: KES 2,000 (0% tax) → Tax: KES 0
- **Total: KES 3,000 (No tax)**

### Example 2: Mixed Products
- Product A: KES 1,000 (0% tax) → Tax: KES 0
- Product B: KES 2,000 (16% tax) → Tax: KES 320
- **Total: KES 3,320**

### Example 3: All Taxable Products
- Product A: KES 1,000 (16% tax) → Tax: KES 160
- Product B: KES 2,000 (16% tax) → Tax: KES 320
- **Total: KES 3,480**

### Example 4: Different Tax Rates
- Product A: KES 1,000 (8% tax) → Tax: KES 80
- Product B: KES 2,000 (16% tax) → Tax: KES 320
- **Total: KES 3,400**

## Database Schema:

The `products` table already has:
```sql
tax_rate DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 0
```

This allows values like:
- 0.00 (no tax)
- 8.00 (8% tax)
- 16.00 (16% VAT)
- 5.50 (5.5% tax)

## Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Run migration successfully
- [ ] Create product with 0% tax
- [ ] Create product with 16% tax
- [ ] Add both products to cart
- [ ] Verify tax calculation on cart
- [ ] Complete sale
- [ ] Check receipt displays correct tax
- [ ] Verify sale record in database has correct amounts
- [ ] Edit existing product and change tax rate
- [ ] Test sale with updated tax rate

---

## Rollback (if needed):

If you need to revert to the old 16% fixed tax system:

```bash
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1
```

Then manually revert the code changes, or keep the flexible system and just set all products to 16%.
