# Admin Orders Management - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive order management functionality for the admin portal, integrating both customer orders (from online shop) and POS sales (walk-in orders) into a unified interface.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Routes Added (`routes/web.php`)
Added the following routes under the admin middleware group:

```php
// Order Management Routes
Route::prefix('orders')->name('orders.')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/', [OrderManagementController::class, 'index'])->name('index');
    Route::get('/customer-order/{id}', [OrderManagementController::class, 'showOrder'])->name('show-order');
    Route::get('/pos-sale/{id}', [OrderManagementController::class, 'showSale'])->name('show-sale');
    Route::post('/customer-order/{id}/update-status', [OrderManagementController::class, 'updateStatus'])->name('update-status');
    Route::get('/customer-order/{id}/print', [OrderManagementController::class, 'printOrder'])->name('print-order');
    Route::get('/pos-sale/{id}/print', [OrderManagementController::class, 'printSale'])->name('print-sale');
