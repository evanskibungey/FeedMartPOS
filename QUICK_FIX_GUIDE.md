## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Command not found"
**Solution**: Make sure you're in the project directory:
```bash
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\FeedMartPOS
```

### Issue: "Migration already exists"
**Solution**: That's fine! Migrations already ran. Just continue to seeding:
```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

### Issue: "Nothing to seed"
**Solution**: Seeders already ran. Check if data exists:
```bash
php test-db.php
```

### Issue: Dropdowns still empty
**Solution**: 
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)
2. Reload page (Ctrl + F5)
3. Verify seeders ran: `php test-db.php`

### Issue: "SQLSTATE error"
**Solution**: Check database connection in `.env` file
```env
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=C:\xampp\htdocs\FeedMartPOS\database\database.sqlite
```
